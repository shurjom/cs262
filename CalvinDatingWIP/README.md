Vision Statement
------------------------
Our Calvin College dating app helps bring together individuals on Calvin's campus who are looking for a match made in heaven. Unlike OKCupid or Match.com, our app has only Calvin students in mind. This allows for our app to find the best possible match to the profile you have created. The app will involve four main menus that allow the user to create a profile, meet new people, talk to them, and plan dates. Users will be matched based on a simple survey that they are required to complete when they create their profile. The app will give suggestions for events to go on a date.

N+1 Architectural Views 
------------------------
- This section provides a variety of views of the system architecture, based on what the Unified Process calls a Software Architecture Document (SAD). This semester, we'll set N=4 by including the following views:
- User View (the +1 view)
- Logical View
- Data View
- Interface View
- Deployment View
Each section should summarizes the key architectural decisions documented in that view and explain why they were made.

Supplemental Specifications 
------------------------
1. Non-functional requirements
-These requirements are necessary for the app to be successful. But they are not specifically implementable.
    1. Only Calvin students can use the app.
    2. Compatable on all Android phones and some tablets, not IOS.
    3. Using the app results in relationships.
    4. A user's profile is secure and doesn't allow for fake profiles.
    5. The app is free from charge.
    6. Not open source. This coould lead to tampering with results.
    7. It should be usable and responsive as well, where usable is defined and understandable to most users in less than five minutes and responsive is defined by giving output within 3 seconds.
2. Test Suite — This test suite specifies how you will test your system and reports on how the testing went, including:
3. Unit testing of your system modules (at levels 0 and 1) (if required by the instructor)
4. System testing of your system functions (at levels 1 and 2)
5. Usability testing

Presentation Materials

The System
------------------------
- This section should allow a user to get a copy of your system (or system prototype), including on-line documentation, and install it in their own environment.
