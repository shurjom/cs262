Polling Help Page
First of all in order to use the polling system you must be a logged in user. If you have not created a login, please go to the login page.

At the top of the page you are able to select between the current polls for both the Knollcrest and Commons Dining halls. 
You can select these by either taping on the names or swiping left and right on the page.

The page will present the current days options and between 2 to 4 responses that can be given for it.
You can select the response you want by tapping on it. Only one response can be selected for each poll.
To submit your response hit the submit button after you have selected a response. 
Once submitted, results for that  poll will be displayed underneath each response and you will not be able to submit a response again for that poll.
